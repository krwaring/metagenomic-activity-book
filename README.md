# Metagenomic Activity Book
This repo is intended to serve as a resource for introductory level metagenomics teaching materials. For those that are new to the field of metagenomics, these activities convey the basics in a low tech, learner-friendly style. By removing the pressure of coding and software usage, the broad ideas behind metagenomic workflows can be more easily conveyed, which makes room for the learner to seek the accompanying software tools from a position of knowledge power rather than getting overwhelmed with too many new things. Each of the activities included in this repo can be printed off individually to supplement coverage of a specific topic, or as a complete workbook for a step by step walkthrough. 

While only a few activities are currently available, contributions of ideas or fully formed activity sheets are being sought.

## Future Ideas
- Add activities with increasing levels of complexity for each module.
- Digitize activities so that can be performed interactively without needing to be printed off.
- Add a narrative element to the activities (e.g. tie them into an overarching story).
*You are invited to add any activity ideas of your own to this open source collection.*
