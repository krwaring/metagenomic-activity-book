# Metagenomic Activity Book
This repo is intended to serve as a resource for the introductory level metagenomics learner or teacher. For those that are new to the field of metagenomics, these activities convey the basics in a very low tech, beginner-friendly style. By removing the pressure of coding and software usage, the broad ideas behind metagenomic workflows can be more easily conveyed, which makes room for the learner to seek the accompanying software tools from a position of knowledge power rather than getting overwhelmed with too many new things. This approach is also based on the idea that people learn in many different ways, and that multiple modes of information delivery can strengthen understanding. A similar approach has been used by [Brown (2012)](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/the-assembly-exercise.html) and [Martin (2012)](https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/499) to develop introductory metagenomics teaching tools, though unfortunately their creations are no longer accessible.

Each of the activities included in this repo can be printed off individually to supplement coverage of a specific topic, or workbook-style. While only four activities are currently available, contributions of activity ideas or fully formed activity sheets are being sought.

## Future Ideas
- Improvements to background section text.
- Add a “Follow-up Questions” section for each activity to encourage extrapolation from the activity to the real process. 
- Add activities for DNA Extraction, Sequencing, Binning, Annotation, and Taxonomy
- Add activities with increasing levels of complexity for each module.
- Digitize activities so that can be performed interactively without needing to be printed off.
- Add a narrative element to the workbook activities that ties them all together (for example, a story line that puts performance of the activities into a greater context).
*You are invited to add any activity ideas of your own to this open source collection!*
